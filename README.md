# Simulation Project
# Bank-Multi-Channel-Queue-Newspapers-Seller 
## Using the discrete event simulation approach
## First problem : Bank_Multi_Channel_Queue
### I calculated and got these requirements, Using python:
#### The average service time of the teller.
#### I calculated and got these requirements
#### The maximum for both queues.
#### The probability that an ordinary customer and a distinguished customer wait in the queue.
#### The portion of idle time of the teller.

## Second problem : Newspapers_Seller
### I calculated and got these requirements, Using python:
#### Determine the optimal number of papers the seller should purchase to increase his profit.
#### How does the price of selling the newspaper and of selling the unsold newspapers as a scrap affect.
#### How does the size of bundle used to purchase newspapers affect.
